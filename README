Urlshrink is a simple URL shortening app (kind of like the ones run at bit.ly or goo.gl but a lot less fancy).

To run, simply run 'ruby urlshrink.rb' in a terminal.

Required Gems:
-Rubygems
-Sinatra (and Sinatra reloader, if you want)
-Dalli
-JSON

The front-end is a simple html+javascript (jQuery) app that communicates to the back end using JSON XHR calls.  Ajax ahoy!

If you'd like to wire up your own front end, here's a simple API definition for you:

1.  GET '/'
    - Just gets index.html.  Nothing too fancy.
2.  GET '/abcdefg'
    -Redirects (via HTTP 301) to the original URL saved for key "abcdefg" or returns a 404.html page if one doesn't exist
3.  POST '/' 
    -POST a JSON key-value pair string here that looks like the following:  {"original" : "http://someurl.com"}
    -Returns one of the following:
        Error: {"errormsg" : "some error message here"}
            -OR-
        Sucess: {"shrunk":"abcdefg", "original":"http://your.original.url\"}  (here, "abcdefg" is the shortened key)
